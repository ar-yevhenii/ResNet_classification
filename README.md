# ResNet Classification of Simpsons Characters

This project focuses on classifying characters from the Simpsons using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and ResNet architecture. The project is divided into two main Jupyter notebooks:

1. `1_SIMPSONS_CUSTOMCNN_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`
2. `2_SIMPSONS_RESNET_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`

## Project Structure

### 1_SIMPSONS_CUSTOMCNN_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb

This notebook includes:
- Importing necessary libraries and checking for CUDA availability.
- Setting up data directories and device configuration.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of characters in the training dataset.
- Custom CNN model training and evaluation.

### 2_SIMPSONS_RESNET_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb

This notebook includes:
- Importing necessary libraries and checking for CUDA availability.
- Setting up data directories and device configuration.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of characters in the training dataset.
- ResNet model training and evaluation.

## Data

The dataset consists of images of various Simpsons characters, divided into training and test sets. The training set contains 58,934 images, while the test set contains 991 images.
